	<h1>Fight the Aliens Along Side the Hobo</h1>
	<img src="images/hospital.jpg" width="400px">
	<p> More alien police come and surround the both of you. You kill a few but are overpowered, they cuff you and you black out. You wake up in a hospital, IV's connected to your arms. A nurse notices your awake and explains that the hobo laced the sunglasses with liquid LSD, causing you to go into a drug rage. The nurse starts to leave the room, you're delirious, but swear that when the nurse left you heard the nurse say,"he believes the story."</p>
